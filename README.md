Nutritional functional trait diversity of crops in south-eastern Senegal
================

Project description
-------------------

This paper proposes a new metric of the nutritional diversity of food systems, called Potential Nutrient Adequacy, and compares this new metric to existing functional trait metrics. I apply these metrics to case-study data on crop nutrient content (i.e. functional traits) from south-eastern Senegal.

To understand the relationships between metrics--and whether observed metric values are different from random--I use a simulation approach that generates randomized communities and calculates functional trait diversity. This repo houses the code used for those simulations.

Randomizing communities
-----------------------

Here is the text from the manuscript describing the process of community randomization:

"To explore relationships between these diversity measures under a null scenario, I simulated random communities for twenty traits—the number of traits included in the calculations described above—but varying levels of species richness. I varied species richness from 3 to 15 species, with a regional species pool of 15, which I chose to reflect the number of species in the regional species pool (13) shown in the functional dendrogram (Figure 2). I simulated 200 communities for each species richness level. Traits were assumed to be uniformly distributed and species abundances were assumed to be lognormally distributed based on visual inspection of histograms of trait distributions and crop relative abundances in the collected data set. Because of the high number of traits relative to species, I ran a sensitivity test with three traits, such that the number of traits was never greater than the number of species. The three-trait results are presented in Figure S1, while full-trait scenarios are in Figures S2 and S3.""
